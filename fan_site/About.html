        Hideki Kamiya is a Japanese video game designer and director. He began his career in 1994 with Capcom, where he directed Resident Evil 2 (1998), Devil May Cry (2001), Viewtiful Joe (2003), and Ōkami (2006). From 2004 to 2006, he worked for the Capcom subsidiary Clover Studio. His projects with PlatinumGames include Bayonetta (2009) and The Wonderful 101 (2013). Unfortunately, he is planning on leaving Platinum Games on October 12th, 2023. This doesn't mean that he is planning on retiring. He quotes, “I’d say, I left the company because I wanted to follow my beliefs as a game creator. And to choose the path I think is right and move on. Yeah, so I’m not going to retire yet. I want to keep creating games.”
