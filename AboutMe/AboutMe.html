            Hello! My name is Long Nguyen and here is a picture of me and Johnny Yong Bosch at C2E2! <br>
            I am currently a senior in Game Art at Columbia College Chicago. I mainly 3D Model props, some environmental stuff and still working on character models and texturing. <br>
            I love watching anime, movies and play video games during my free time. <br>
            I used to have a pet cat name Monie, but unfortunately he passed away in March, 2021.
